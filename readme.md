# GraphQL + Sanic + SQLAlchemy

I wanted to create a simple minimal starter utilizing SQLAlchemy, Sanic, and GraphQL.

### Running locally

To run install the requirements.txt 
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt


then run the application by running app.py

    python app.py


you'll be able to access the URL of GRAPHIQL at http://localhost:8000/graphql


# Sanic

### Running with Docker

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build sanicgql
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml run --service-ports sanicgql
