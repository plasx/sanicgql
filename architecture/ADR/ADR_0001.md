# Simple Sanic, GraphQL, and SQLAlchemy Application 


## Status

Sanic superseds flask as awsgi compatible web framework. In the current state of flask, it currently does not support ASGI and is not asynchronous friendly.  

## Context
Mainstream web frameworks not supporting asyncio/asgi out the box  
## Decision

Utilize Sanic as a replacement for flask

## Consequences

While sanic enables us to utilize asgi and async event loops natively within the framework. we lose the vast amount of support and maturity that's behind flask. This means we will have to wait for more support or possibly take the risk of the framework not taking off and having no longer maintained legacy web framework in the future.
