# Angular Frontend


## Status
in the current state there is no framework chosen for the project, which mean's i'll have to use either the graphql explorer to utilze it.

## Context
no frontend framework implemented
## Decision

utilze the latest version of angular with apollo to consume the graphql sanic api

## Consequences

Using a framework on the frontend enables us to utlize 3rd party libraries that integrate with angular such as apollo. Learning Angular will give some insight on pro/con descisions when it comes to using React.js
